I rode my freewheel unicycle on an easy dirt path. A freewheel unicycle is harder to balance on than a regular direct drive unicycle but a braking style of riding is easier than a pure coasting style and I'm improving with practice. The dirt path was fairly easy so now I have to find try some harder trails.

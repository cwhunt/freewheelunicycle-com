Here's some video of freewheel unicycling on hills. In the first part I try to ride down a short section without using the brake to see how fast I can go. My estimate is 8-9 MPH. In the second part I use the brake while descending the hills. I'm getting my 26" freewheel unicycle soon so I wanted to try to remember how the 20" behaved on these hills so I can compare.

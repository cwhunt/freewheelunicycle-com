On Friday, December 16, 2022, a bunch of us met up down at the docks in Morro Bay to juggle. Here is some of what we did:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=0s" target="_blank">00:00</a> While I was setting up my camera, Barry, Kevin, and Mario juggled in a 4-count feed doing what is colloquially known as throwing crap. 

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=11s" target="_blank">00:11</a> I joined in a shadowbox. 

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=43s" target="_blank">00:43</a> We did a 4-count crossing pattern. 

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=70s" target="_blank">01:10</a> I convinced everyone to try out a chopped star arrangement which is a star minus one point. We started with Barry feeding me and Mario in 4-count and Mario feeding Barry and Kevin in 4-count. We changed it so that Barry was feeding me Mario in chocolate bar (pass pass self self). That kept Mario and Kevin the same but I changed to passing 4-count with Barry second beat left. Mario then swapped places with Barry. 

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=130s" target="_blank">02:10</a> Mario then extemporaneously worked out a pattern I'm calling Mario's Meteor Shower. It's similar to Shooting Star except that it's with 11 clubs instead of 9 and there's continuous juggling. It's basically a way to juggle a 4-count star pass pattern with only four jugglers and I'm working on a video to demonstrate it in more detail.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=195s" target="_blank">03:15</a> Mario had the great idea to put tape down for marks to stand on.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=373s" target="_blank">06:13</a> Mario had us mixing a chocolate bar feed and 4-count feed. I've discussed this kind of a pattern in my video "Juggling patterns for 4 jugglers" but that was in a box arrangement. Mario's arrangement was more of a squashed box which pushed together the jugglers who weren't passing with each other.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=437s" target="_blank">07:17</a> Mario and Barry juggled 7-club singles getting closer and closer together.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=527s" target="_blank">08:47</a> Me, Barry, and Mario juggled patterns in triangle.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=565s" target="_blank">09:25</a> I convinced Barry and Mario to work on my pattern Rotating Polygon Countdown 3.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=601s" target="_blank">10:01</a> Barry and Mario did a quick run of 8-club passing.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=637s" target="_blank">10:37</a> Me and Mario passed 7 clubs.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=644s" target="_blank">10:44</a> Kevin joined in a 10-club feed with Mario feeding.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=682s" target="_blank">11:22</a> I switched to feeding 10-club.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=706s" target="_blank">11:46</a> Mario fed me and Kevin in a pattern where he starts with two clubs in each hand.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=760s" target="_blank">12:40</a> We went back to a 10-club feed with Mario feeding.

<a class="yt-chapter-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfMNaZDRUNU&t=812s" target="_blank">13:32</a> We ended the night by working on a 10-club triangle.

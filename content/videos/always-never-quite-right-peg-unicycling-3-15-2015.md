A few clips from my initial practice riding my peg unicycle. The first one has a very slow runup to a sudden elevation change. This would be fun to practice pumping if the initial decline wasn't so gradual. The other clips are from a place that has a better decline although when I pump my tires up more I can get another 1-2 mph or so from the 9-10 mph on these runs.

I sometimes practice riding my freewheel unicycle at a small BMX track. At the entrance there are three dips of varying difficulty which I've dubbed The Three Bears. I was able to ride the easiest one (Baby Bear) with my 20" freewheel unicycle. Now that I have a 26" freewheel unicycle I can ride the next hardest one (Mama Bear) both ways and the hardest one (Papa Bear) one way.

The Nimbus Drift Trike Disc hub this unicycle is built around is at:

This video will probably only have appeal to hardcore freewheel unicycle enthusiasts who want to see one in action on single track and people interested in checking out sections of the the Johnson Ranch trail in San Luis Obispo, California. I just got a refurbished Drift HD 720 camera and wanted to try it out. It's mostly mounted on my helmet with one section at the end starting at 10:45 where I put it on my unicycle. Apologies for the grunting and heavy breathing but I'm keeping it real!

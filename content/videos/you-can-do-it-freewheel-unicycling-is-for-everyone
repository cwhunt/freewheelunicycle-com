With awesome new unicycle-specific hubs available or soon to be available, this is a great time for freewheel unicycling and you'll probably be seeing an influx of fantastic new videos of elite riders doing amazing feats. This video is a reminder that like fixed wheel unicycling, freewheel unicycling is a proficiency skill. You may not be as sweaty as me or as overweight or as out of shape, but if you practice enough you'll learn to ride.

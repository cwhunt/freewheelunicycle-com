I previously made a very simple freewheel unicycling tutorial but this one shows the basic techniques and then how they're applied on a ride. The riding shows four styles:
1. The basic style a beginner would use which is pedals up and down. In the video I'm riding switch stance to simulate this.
2. Pedals up and down which is a conservative riding style used in situations where maximum control is necessary like around hikers, dogs, cars, and some precipices.
3. Pedals level with intermittent braking.
4. Coasting pedals level.
Listen for the click of the brake lever and pay attention to pedal position, frame angle, and how much I'm on or off the saddle.

Coming back to my car from my the Friday weekly ride there's a nice downhill sidewalk with a speedometer sign and here are a few runs with my helmet camera pointed down. It's not hard to push it to 12-15 MPH but on the last run I had the not-so-bright idea to brake suddenly to try to get the sign in the video with predictable results. I like the shadow effect from the street lights and the buzzing of the tire.

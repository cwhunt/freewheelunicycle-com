In my opinion these are the 7 basic modes of riding a freewheel unicycle:

1. extended pedaling
2. extended brake-coasting
3. extended coasting
4. alternating pedaling and brake-coasting
5. alternating pedaling and coasting
6. alternating pedaling, brake-coasting, and coasting
7. alternating brake-coasting and coasting

This dirt road doesn't have steep enough sections to practice #2 or #7 so I practice the other modes on it as drills depending on the grade and how tired I am.
